# bank-loan-risk-analysis
This project conducts an analysis of the Lending Club loan dataset to identify patterns and risk factors associated with loan default. It integrates authentic financial data with Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical hypothesis testing, and interpretable machine learning to replicate a professional banking risk workflow.

# Main Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the loan application dataset
- Identify the correlation between borrower traits and loan status
- Build an interpretable logistic regression model to predict loan defaults
- Visualize insights and key risk factors for decision-makers
